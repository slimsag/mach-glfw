Perfected GLFW bindings for Zig

## Features

* Zero-fuss installation, cross-compilation at the flip of a switch, and broad platform support.
* 100% API coverage. Every function, type, constant, etc. has been exposed in a ziggified API.

## Community maintained

The [Mach engine](https://machengine.org/) project no longer uses GLFW, and so this project is now community-maintained. Pull requests are welcome and will be reviewed. The project will still target [nominated Zig versions](https://machengine.org/docs/nominated-zig/) (and may only incidentally work on other Zig versions) but may not see regular updates as it is no longer a Mach project (see [hexops/mach#1166](https://github.com/hexops/mach/issues/1166)).

Some old documentation is available at https://machengine.org/v0.4/pkg/mach-glfw/
